// Copied from wc3-slop-lan (library/slop.d.ts): the map library its test harness injects.
/**
 * wc3-slop-lan's map library (slop.lua), for TypeScript-to-Lua maps. The harness injects it
 * into a staged copy of the map, so it is undefined in every normal build: always guard. Its
 * functions are plain table fields, called with a dot (no self), hence `this: void` throughout.
 *
 *     if (Slop !== undefined) {
 *         Slop.onCommand((player, line) => myCommands.run(player, line));
 *     }
 *
 * See docs/library.md.
